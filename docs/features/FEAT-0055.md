# Course Area Task Management

**ID:** FEAT-0055 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

Task planning and management system for courses and areas with flexible categorization

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Course maintenance tasks need to be organized by specific areas of the course, but there's no structured way to define, categorize, and manage these area-specific tasks with their requirements and characteristics.

### Solution
Build a comprehensive task management system that allows creation of tasks tied to specific course areas, with details on what needs to be done, equipment needed, skill requirements, and estimated completion time.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Assistant Superintendents
- Crew Leaders

### Success Criteria
- Tasks can be created and assigned to specific course areas
- Task definitions include equipment, skills, and time estimates
- Tasks can be filtered and viewed by area
- Task library can be reused across scheduling periods

### Assumptions
- Course areas are already defined in the system
- Equipment catalog exists
- Skill taxonomy is established

### Dependencies
- Course mapping system
- Equipment management
- Skill definitions

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Actual scheduling of tasks
- Task assignment to workers
- Historical task completion tracking

### Risks
- Task definitions may become outdated
- Equipment requirements may change seasonally
