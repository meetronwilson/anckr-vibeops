GDD, weather, and disease window monitoring per area to trigger application recommendations.

**Owner:** Product Manager

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Optimal application timing depends on complex environmental factors including GDD thresholds, weather windows, and disease pressure. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and error-prone.

### Goals
1. Monitor GDD accumulation per area and grass type
2. Track weather windows for optimal applications
3. Identify disease pressure windows
4. Generate automatic trigger alerts

### Success Metrics
- **Applications within optimal window:** 95%
- **False positive trigger rate:** <5%
- **Trigger notification latency:** ≤15 minutes

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- GDD tracking
- Weather window analysis
- Disease window identification
- Area-specific thresholds
- Trigger notifications

**Out of Scope:**
- Predictive disease modeling
- Soil analysis integration
- Custom trigger programming

### Dependencies
- Weather integration
- GDD service
- Area management system
