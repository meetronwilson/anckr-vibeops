# Task Recurrence & Scheduling Rules

**ID:** FEAT-0056 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** critical

Flexible scheduling system with recurrence patterns and rules for task automation

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Course maintenance tasks occur on various schedules - some daily, some on specific days of the week, some monthly or seasonally. Without a flexible recurrence system, superintendents must manually recreate tasks repeatedly, leading to missed maintenance windows and scheduling inconsistencies.

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive recurrence engine that supports multiple pattern types (daily, weekly with day selection, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, seasonal, annual) with the ability to set preferences, handle exceptions, and adjust for weather or course conditions.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Assistant Superintendents
- Maintenance Planners

### Success Criteria
- Support for all common recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Ability to specify exact days of week for weekly tasks
- Seasonal scheduling with start/end dates
- Exception handling for holidays and events
- Weather-dependent task scheduling
- Preview of generated schedule before commitment

### Assumptions
- Calendar system is available
- Weather data integration exists
- Course events calendar is accessible

### Dependencies
- Task definitions
- Calendar system
- Weather service integration
- Course events system

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Automatic rescheduling of missed tasks
- AI-powered schedule optimization
- Integration with third-party calendar apps

### Risks
- Complex recurrence rules may be difficult for users to configure
- Weather-dependent scheduling may create unpredictable workload
- Seasonal transitions may cause confusion
