# Worker Skills & Training Management

**ID:** FEAT-0058 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

Skills tracking, training management, and certification system for workers

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Superintendents need to assign workers to tasks based on their skills and certifications, but tracking who is trained on what equipment, who has current certifications, and proficiency levels is manual and error-prone, leading to safety issues and inefficient assignments.

### Solution
Build a comprehensive skills tracking system where each worker has a skills profile showing certifications (pesticide applicator, equipment operation, etc.), training completion dates, expiration dates, and proficiency levels. System should alert when certifications are expiring and support training record uploads.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Crew Leaders
- HR Managers
- Safety Officers

### Success Criteria
- Skills taxonomy defined for golf course maintenance
- Workers can be assigned multiple skills with proficiency levels
- Certification tracking with expiration dates and alerts
- Training history with documentation storage
- Reporting on skill gaps and training needs
- Integration with task assignment to match skills to requirements
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

### Assumptions
- Standard skills taxonomy can be defined
- Required certifications are documented
- Training documentation can be digitized

### Dependencies
- Worker profiles
- Task definitions with skill requirements
- Document storage
- Notification system

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Creating training content
- Learning management system (LMS) features
- Third-party training provider integration

### Risks
- Certification expiration tracking must be reliable for compliance
- Skill proficiency assessment may be subjective
- Maintaining up-to-date skill requirements per task
