# Worker Profile Management

**ID:** FEAT-0057 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

Comprehensive worker profile management with contact information and emergency details

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Managing detailed information about crew members is currently scattered across multiple systems or paper records, making it difficult to access critical worker information quickly and maintain up-to-date employee records.

### Solution
Create a centralized worker profile system that stores all essential employee information including contact details, employment history, certifications, and identification photos. Profiles should be easily accessible and updatable with appropriate access controls.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- HR Managers
- Crew Leaders
- Administrative Staff

### Success Criteria
- Complete worker profiles with all essential information
- Photo upload and storage for crew identification
- Emergency contact information readily accessible
- Employment history tracking (hire date, promotions, etc.)
- Role-based access controls for sensitive information
- Quick search and filtering of worker roster

### Assumptions
- Basic HR processes are documented
- Photo storage infrastructure exists
- Privacy/compliance requirements are defined

### Dependencies
- User authentication system
- File storage service
- Access control framework

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Full HRIS integration
- Background check management
- I-9 and tax document storage

### Risks
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, state laws) require careful data handling
- Photo requirements may have legal implications
- Data security is critical for PII
