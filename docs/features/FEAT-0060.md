**ID:** FEAT-0060 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

PTO and leave management system with accrual tracking and approvals

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Managing worker time off requests, tracking PTO balances, and planning crew schedules around absences is currently manual, leading to scheduling conflicts, incorrect PTO balances, and disputes over available time off.

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive PTO management system with configurable accrual rules, leave type definitions (vacation, sick, personal, etc.), request/approval workflows, balance tracking, and integration with crew scheduling to prevent understaffing.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Crew Leaders
- HR Managers
- Workers/Crew Members

### Success Criteria
- Workers can view their PTO balances in real-time
- Self-service PTO request submission
- Approval workflow with notifications
- Flexible accrual rules (per pay period, annual, etc.)
- Multiple leave types with separate balances
- Calendar view of team absences
- Alerts when PTO request would cause understaffing
- Historical leave tracking and reporting

### Assumptions
- PTO policies are documented
- Approval hierarchy is defined
- Workers have access to submit requests

### Dependencies
- Worker profiles
- Notification system
- Calendar system
- Crew scheduling module
- Approval workflow engine

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- FMLA and other regulated leave tracking
- Integration with payroll for PTO payout
- Shift swap/coverage management

### Risks
- Complex accrual rules may be difficult to configure
- Ensuring fair and consistent PTO approval
- Preventing scheduling gaps due to multiple concurrent absences
