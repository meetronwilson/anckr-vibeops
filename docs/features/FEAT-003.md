# Application Proposals

**ID:** FEAT-003 | **Module:** MOD-001 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

Prescriptive chemical and fertilizer application plans generated from weather and agronomic triggers.

**Owner:** Product Manager

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Timing chemical and fertilizer applications correctly requires monitoring weather, GDD, disease windows, and agronomic conditions. Superintendents need proactive recommendations based on these triggers.

### Goals
1. Automatically propose applications when triggers are met
2. Generate prescriptive plans with product, rate, and timing details
3. Provide rationale for each recommendation
4. Enable easy approval or modification of proposals

### Success Metrics
- **Applications within optimal window:** 95%
- **Missed application windows:** Reduced by 80%
- **Time to create application plan:** Reduced by 85%

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Weather-based trigger monitoring
- GDD threshold tracking
- Disease window identification
- Product and rate recommendations
- Application timing optimization
- Rationale and context for proposals

**Out of Scope:**
- Fully automated application execution
- Product ordering/procurement
- Custom product formulations

### Dependencies
- Triggers engine must be operational
- Products catalog must be available
- Weather integration must be connected
- GDD service must be implemented
