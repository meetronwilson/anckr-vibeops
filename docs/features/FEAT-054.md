# Data Seeder/Simulator

**ID:** FEAT-054 | **Module:** MOD-011 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** medium

Generate realistic weather, sensor, and application activity data for demos and testing.

**Owner:** Product Manager

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Demos and testing require realistic data that simulates real-world usage patterns. Manual data creation is time-consuming and often unrealistic.

### Goals
1. Generate weather simulation data
2. Create sensor readings
3. Simulate application activity
4. Produce realistic patterns
5. Support time-compressed scenarios

### Success Metrics
- **Data generation time:** ≤5 minutes for full scenario
- **Data realism score:** 4.5/5.0

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Weather data generation
- Sensor reading simulation
- Application activity
- Labor activity
- Time-compressed scenarios

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time simulation
- Complex environmental models
- User behavior simulation

### Dependencies
- Data models
- Seeding infrastructure
- Random data generators
