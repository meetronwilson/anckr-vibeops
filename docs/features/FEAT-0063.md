# Payroll Integration & Time Export

**ID:** FEAT-0063 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** medium

Payroll integration and time export functionality for accounting systems

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Payroll data must be manually compiled from timesheets, PTO records, and salary information then entered into payroll systems, creating a time-consuming, error-prone process that delays payroll processing.

### Solution
Create an export module that consolidates worker hours (from timesheets), PTO usage, salary/rate information, and generates files in standard payroll formats (CSV, IIF for QuickBooks, Excel) with field mapping configuration for different payroll providers.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- HR Managers
- Payroll Administrators
- Accounting Staff

### Success Criteria
- Export payroll data for selected pay period
- Support multiple payroll system formats
- Configurable field mapping
- Include regular hours, overtime, PTO
- Validate data before export
- Audit trail of exports
- Preview export before finalizing
- Support for partial/correction exports

### Assumptions
- Payroll processed externally
- Standard export formats are acceptable
- Pay periods are defined

### Dependencies
- Timesheet system
- PTO management
- Compensation data
- Worker profiles

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Direct API integration with payroll systems
- Payroll calculation/processing
- Tax calculations
- Direct deposit setup

### Risks
- Export format compatibility issues
- Data accuracy is critical for correct pay
- Different payroll providers may need custom formats
