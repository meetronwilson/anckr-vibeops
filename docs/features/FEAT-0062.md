# Worker Schedule Management

**ID:** FEAT-0062 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** critical

Advanced worker schedule management with conflict detection and availability tracking

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Creating crew schedules that account for worker availability, skills, PTO, and task requirements is time-consuming and prone to errors. Workers often don't know their schedule until the last minute, causing confusion and no-shows.

### Solution
Build a comprehensive scheduling system that allows superintendents to create weekly/monthly schedules, assign workers to shifts, detect conflicts (PTO, double-booking), match skills to tasks, and publish schedules for workers to view. Include worker availability input and shift swap requests.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Crew Leaders
- Workers/Crew Members

### Success Criteria
- Visual schedule builder with drag-and-drop
- Automatic conflict detection (PTO, skills, availability)
- Workers can view their schedule in advance
- Workers can input availability preferences
- Shift swap request and approval workflow
- Schedule templates for recurring patterns
- Notifications when schedule is published or changed
- Mobile access to schedule
- Integration with task assignments

### Assumptions
- Shift patterns are relatively consistent
- Workers have mobile access
- PTO system is integrated

### Dependencies
- Worker profiles
- PTO management
- Skills tracking
- Task assignments
- Notification system

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Automated schedule generation/AI optimization
- Time clock integration
- Labor law compliance checking

### Risks
- Last-minute schedule changes may cause issues
- Shift swap abuse
- Ensuring adequate coverage
- Workers may not update availability
