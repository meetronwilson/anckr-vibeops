# KML Drop

**ID:** FEAT-035 | **Module:** MOD-007 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** high

Rapid course mapping by dropping KML files exported from Google Earth or other GIS tools.

Manual area mapping is tedious. Many courses already have KML files from Google Earth. Drag-and-drop KML import enables rapid course digitization.

### Goals
1. Enable KML drag-and-drop
2. Parse and validate KML
3. Auto-create course areas
4. Preview before import

### Success Metrics
- **Course mapping time:** ≤30 minutes
- **Import success rate:** 90%

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Drag-and-drop interface
- KML parsing
- Area auto-creation
- Import preview
- Basic validation

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced KML features
- Real-time collaboration
- Version control
