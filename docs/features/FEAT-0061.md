# Worker Communication Hub

**ID:** FEAT-0061 | **Module:** MOD-0012 | **Status:** draft | **Priority:** medium

Worker communication hub for announcements, messages, and notifications

**Owner:** Product Team

## PRD Summary

### Problem
Communication with individual workers about schedules, policies, performance, and administrative matters happens across multiple channels (text, email, in-person) with no centralized record, making it difficult to track what was communicated and when.

### Solution
Create a worker-specific communication hub where superintendents and managers can send messages, share documents, post announcements, and require acknowledgment of important information. All communications are logged and searchable for reference.

### Target Users
- Golf Course Superintendents
- Crew Leaders
- HR Managers
- Workers/Crew Members

### Success Criteria
- Send direct messages to individual workers
- Share documents with specific workers or groups
- Post announcements with read receipts
- Require acknowledgment for policy updates
- Complete communication history per worker
- Search across communications
- Mobile-friendly for workers to access
- Email/SMS notifications for new messages

### Assumptions
- Workers have mobile access or can access system
- Email/phone numbers are current
- Basic notification infrastructure exists

### Dependencies
- Worker profiles
- Notification system
- Document storage
- Mobile app or responsive web interface

### Scope
**Out of Scope:**
- Team chat/group messaging
- Video calling
- Integration with personal email/SMS apps
- Translation services

### Risks
- Workers may not check messages regularly
- Notification fatigue
- Privacy concerns with message content
- Ensuring professional communication standards
