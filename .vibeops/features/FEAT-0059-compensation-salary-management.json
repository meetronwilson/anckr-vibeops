    "problem": "Tracking worker compensation, salary changes, raises, and pay history is typically managed in separate systems or spreadsheets, making it difficult to maintain accurate records, plan budgets, and ensure pay equity.",
    "solution": "Create a compensation management module that tracks current pay rates (hourly or salary), maintains complete salary history with effective dates and reasons for changes, supports pay grade structures, and provides reporting for budget planning and compliance.",
