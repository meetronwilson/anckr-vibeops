    "problem": "Course maintenance tasks occur on various schedules - some daily, some on specific days of the week, some monthly or seasonally. Without a flexible recurrence system, superintendents must manually recreate tasks repeatedly, leading to missed maintenance windows and scheduling inconsistencies.",
    "solution": "Implement a comprehensive recurrence engine that supports multiple pattern types (daily, weekly with day selection, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, seasonal, annual) with the ability to set preferences, handle exceptions, and adjust for weather or course conditions.",

    "successCriteria": [
      "Support for all common recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)",
      "Ability to specify exact days of week for weekly tasks",
      "Seasonal scheduling with start/end dates",
      "Exception handling for holidays and events",
