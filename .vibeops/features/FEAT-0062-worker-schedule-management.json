    "problem": "Creating crew schedules that account for worker availability, skills, PTO, and task requirements is time-consuming and prone to errors. Workers often don't know their schedule until the last minute, causing confusion and no-shows.",
    "solution": "Build a comprehensive scheduling system that allows superintendents to create weekly/monthly schedules, assign workers to shifts, detect conflicts (PTO, double-booking), match skills to tasks, and publish schedules for workers to view. Include worker availability input and shift swap requests.",
