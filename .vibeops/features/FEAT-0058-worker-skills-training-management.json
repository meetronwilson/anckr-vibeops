  "prd": {
    "problem": "Superintendents need to assign workers to tasks based on their skills and certifications, but tracking who is trained on what equipment, who has current certifications, and proficiency levels is manual and error-prone, leading to safety issues and inefficient assignments.",
    "solution": "Build a comprehensive skills tracking system where each worker has a skills profile showing certifications (pesticide applicator, equipment operation, etc.), training completion dates, expiration dates, and proficiency levels. System should alert when certifications are expiring and support training record uploads.",
